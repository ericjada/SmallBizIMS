## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please take a moment to understand the project and its structure. The IMS is an application built using Python, `Tkinter` for the UI, `SQLite` for the database, and several other libraries such as `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Cryptography`.

### Prerequisites

To contribute, you need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- SQLite
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, fork the repository to your GitHub account and then clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ims.git
cd ims
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, you need to install the project dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary libraries such as `Tkinter`, `bcrypt`, `Pandas`, and more.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, have feature requests, or questions about the project, feel free to open an issue in the repository. Please be as detailed as possible and include:

1. A clear description of the issue.
2. Steps to reproduce the problem.
3. Screenshots (if applicable).
4. Your operating system and Python version.

---

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Install all required packages with `pip` as mentioned earlier.
2. Ensure the SQLite database (`inventory_encrypted.db`) is set up correctly.
3. Run the application by executing:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should now have the Inventory Management System running on your local machine.

---

## Code Style and Guidelines

We follow **PEP8** for Python code styling. Before submitting your code, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines. Here are some key points:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Write descriptive comments and docstrings.
- Keep function names and variable names meaningful.
- Ensure that your code is well-documented and easy to understand.
  
To check your code style, you can use `flake8`:

```bash
pip install flake8
flake8 .
```

## Contributing Code

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork the main repository and clone it to your local machine. Always work on a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

### 2. Write Descriptive Commit Messages

Commit messages should clearly explain what the change is and why it was made:

```bash
git commit -m "Add feature X to improve Y"
```

### 3. Add Documentation

If your change introduces new functionality or modifies existing features, update the `README.md` and relevant docstrings to reflect the changes.

### 4. Test Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, make sure everything works as expected. Run the application locally and test the functionality you worked on.

---

## Testing

We encourage the use of unit tests to verify the integrity of the codebase. Write tests for the new functionality you implement. You can run tests using:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Ensure that your changes are working as expected and that you've followed the [Code Style and Guidelines](#code-style-and-guidelines).
2. Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

3. Submit a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository. Please provide a detailed description of the changes you've made, why they were necessary, and how they were tested.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a positive environment for the community. Be respectful, collaborate in good faith, and communicate clearly.
